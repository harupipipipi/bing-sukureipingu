  * # Python 3: Fibonacci series up to n
        >>> def fib(n):
        >>>     a, b = 0, 1
        >>>     while a < n:
        >>>         print(a, end=' ')
        >>>         a, b = b, a+b
        >>>     print()

        0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144 233 377 610 987

# Functions Defined

The core of extensible programming is defining functions. Python allows mandatory and optional arguments, keyword arguments, and even arbitrary argument lists. [More about defining functions in Python 3](//docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)

  * # Python 3: List comprehensions
        >>> fruits = ['Banana', 'Apple', 'Lime']
        >>> loud_fruits = [fruit.upper() for fruit in fruits]
        >>> print(loud_fruits)
        ['BANANA', 'APPLE', 'LIME']
        
        # List and the enumerate function
        >>> list(enumerate(fruits))
        [(0, 'Banana'), (1, 'Apple'), (2, 'Lime')]

# Compound Data Types

Lists (known as arrays in other languages) are one of the compound data types that Python understands. Lists can be indexed, sliced and manipulated with other built-in functions. [More about lists in Python 3](//docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists)

  * # Python 3: Simple arithmetic
        >>> 1 / 2
        0.5
        >>> 2 ** 3
        8
        >>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
        5.666666666666667
        >>> 17 // 3  # floor division
        5

# Intuitive Interpretation

Calculations are simple with Python, and expression syntax is straightforward: the operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` work as expected; parentheses `()` can be used for grouping. [More about simple math functions in Python 3](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#using-python-as-a-calculator).

  * # For loop on a list
        >>> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
        >>> product = 1
        >>> for number in numbers:
        ...    product = product * number
        ... 
        >>> print('The product is:', product)
        The product is: 384

# All the Flow You’d Expect

Python knows the usual control flow statements that other languages speak — `if`, `for`, `while` and `range` — with some of its own twists, of course. [More control flow tools in Python 3](//docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)

  * # Simple output (with Unicode)
        >>> print("Hello, I'm Python!")
        Hello, I'm Python!
        # Input, assignment
        >>> name = input('What is your name?\n')
        What is your name?
        Python
        >>> print(f'Hi, {name}.')
        Hi, Python.
        

# Quick & Easy to Learn

Experienced programmers in any other language can pick up Python very quickly, and beginners find the clean syntax and indentation structure easy to learn. [Whet your appetite](//docs.python.org/3/tutorial/) with our Python 3 overview.
