# Functions Defined

The core of extensible programming is defining functions. Python allows mandatory and optional arguments, keyword arguments, and even arbitrary argument lists. [More about defining functions in Python 3](//docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#defining-functions)

  * # Python 3: List comprehensions
        >>> fruits = ['Banana', 'Apple', 'Lime']
        >>> loud_fruits = [fruit.upper() for fruit in fruits]
        >>> print(loud_fruits)
        ['BANANA', 'APPLE', 'LIME']
        
        # List and the enumerate function
        >>> list(enumerate(fruits))
        [(0, 'Banana'), (1, 'Apple'), (2, 'Lime')]

# Compound Data Types

Lists (known as arrays in other languages) are one of the compound data types that Python understands. Lists can be indexed, sliced and manipulated with other built-in functions. [More about lists in Python 3](//docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#lists)

  * # Python 3: Simple arithmetic
        >>> 1 / 2
        0.5
        >>> 2 ** 3
        8
        >>> 17 / 3  # classic division returns a float
        5.666666666666667
        >>> 17 // 3  # floor division
        5

# Intuitive Interpretation

Calculations are simple with Python, and expression syntax is straightforward: the operators `+`, `-`, `*` and `/` work as expected; parentheses `()` can be used for grouping. [More about simple math functions in Python 3](http://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html#using-python-as-a-calculator).

  * # For loop on a list
        >>> numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
        >>> product = 1
        >>> for number in numbers:
        ...    product = product * number
        ... 
        >>> print('The product is:', product)
        The product is: 384

# All the Flow You’d Expect

Python knows the usual control flow statements that other languages speak — `if`, `for`, `while` and `range` — with some of its own twists, of course. [More control flow tools in Python 3](//docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html)

  * # Simple output (with Unicode)
        >>> print("Hello, I'm Python!")
        Hello, I'm Python!
        # Input, assignment
        >>> name = input('What is your name?\n')
        What is your name?
        Python
        >>> print(f'Hi, {name}.')
        Hi, Python.

# The Python Tutorial¶

Tip

This tutorial is designed for _programmers_ that are new to the Python language, **not** _beginners_ who are new to programming.

Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has efficient high-level data structures and a simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming. Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language for scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.

The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for all major platforms from the Python web site, <https://www.python.org/>, and may be freely distributed. The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs and tools, and additional documentation.

The Python interpreter is easily extended with new functions and data types implemented in C or C++ (or other languages callable from C). Python is also suitable as an extension language for customizable applications.

This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and system. Be aware that it expects you to have a basic understanding of programming in general. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.

For a description of standard objects and modules, see [The Python Standard Library](../library/index.html#library-index). [The Python Language Reference](../reference/index.html#reference-index) gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read [Extending and Embedding the Python Interpreter](../extending/index.html#extending-index) and [Python/C API Reference Manual](../c-api/index.html#c-api-index). There are also several books covering Python in depth.

This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly used feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of the language’s flavor and style. After reading it, you will be able to read and write Python modules and programs, and you will be ready to learn more about the various Python library modules described in [The Python Standard Library](../library/index.html#library-index).

## Contributing to CPython

For more complete instructions on contributing to CPython development, see the [Developer Guide](https://devguide.python.org/).

## Using Python

Installable Python kits, and information about using Python, are available at [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

## Build Instructions

On Unix, Linux, BSD, macOS, and Cygwin:
    
    
    ./configure
    make
    make test
    sudo make install
    

This will install Python as `python3`.

You can pass many options to the configure script; run `./configure --help` to find out more. On macOS case-insensitive file systems and on Cygwin, the executable is called `python.exe`; elsewhere it's just `python`.

Building a complete Python installation requires the use of various additional third-party libraries, depending on your build platform and configure options. Not all standard library modules are buildable or usable on all platforms. Refer to the [Install dependencies](https://devguide.python.org/getting-started/setup-building.html#build-dependencies) section of the [Developer Guide](https://devguide.python.org/) for current detailed information on dependencies for various Linux distributions and macOS.

On macOS, there are additional configure and build options related to macOS framework and universal builds. Refer to [Mac/README.rst](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Mac/README.rst).

On Windows, see [PCbuild/readme.txt](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/PCbuild/readme.txt).

To build Windows installer, see [Tools/msi/README.txt](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Tools/msi/README.txt).

If you wish, you can create a subdirectory and invoke configure from there. For example:
    
    
    mkdir debug
    cd debug
    ../configure --with-pydebug
    make
    make test
    

(This will fail if you _also_ built at the top-level directory. You should do a `make clean` at the top-level first.)

To get an optimized build of Python, `configure --enable-optimizations` before you run `make`. This sets the default make targets up to enable Profile Guided Optimization (PGO) and may be used to auto-enable Link Time Optimization (LTO) on some platforms. For more details, see the sections below.

### Profile Guided Optimization

PGO takes advantage of recent versions of the GCC or Clang compilers. If used, either via `configure --enable-optimizations` or by manually running `make profile-opt` regardless of configure flags, the optimized build process will perform the following steps:

The entire Python directory is cleaned of temporary files that may have resulted from a previous compilation.

An instrumented version of the interpreter is built, using suitable compiler flags for each flavor. Note that this is just an intermediary step. The binary resulting from this step is not good for real-life workloads as it has profiling instructions embedded inside.

After the instrumented interpreter is built, the Makefile will run a training workload. This is necessary in order to profile the interpreter's execution. Note also that any output, both stdout and stderr, that may appear at this step is suppressed.

The final step is to build the actual interpreter, using the information collected from the instrumented one. The end result will be a Python binary that is optimized; suitable for distribution or production installation.

### Link Time Optimization

Enabled via configure's `--with-lto` flag. LTO takes advantage of the ability of recent compiler toolchains to optimize across the otherwise arbitrary `.o` file boundary when building final executables or shared libraries for additional performance gains.

## What's New

We have a comprehensive overview of the changes in the [What's new in Python 3.15](https://docs.python.org/3.15/whatsnew/3.15.html) document. For a more detailed change log, read [Misc/NEWS](https://github.com/python/cpython/tree/main/Misc/NEWS.d), but a full accounting of changes can only be gleaned from the [commit history](https://github.com/python/cpython/commits/main).

If you want to install multiple versions of Python, see the section below entitled "Installing multiple versions".

## Documentation

[Documentation for Python 3.15](https://docs.python.org/3.15/) is online, updated daily.

It can also be downloaded in many formats for faster access. The documentation is downloadable in HTML, PDF, and reStructuredText formats; the latter version is primarily for documentation authors, translators, and people with special formatting requirements.

For information about building Python's documentation, refer to [Doc/README.rst](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/main/Doc/README.rst).

## Testing

To test the interpreter, type `make test` in the top-level directory. The test set produces some output. You can generally ignore the messages about skipped tests due to optional features which can't be imported. If a message is printed about a failed test or a traceback or core dump is produced, something is wrong.

By default, tests are prevented from overusing resources like disk space and memory. To enable these tests, run `make buildbottest`.

If any tests fail, you can re-run the failing test(s) in verbose mode. For example, if `test_os` and `test_gdb` failed, you can run:
    
    
    make test TESTOPTS="-v test_os test_gdb"
    

If the failure persists and appears to be a problem with Python rather than your environment, you can [file a bug report](https://github.com/python/cpython/issues) and include relevant output from that command to show the issue.

See [Running & Writing Tests](https://devguide.python.org/testing/run-write-tests.html) for more on running tests.

## Installing multiple versions

On Unix and Mac systems if you intend to install multiple versions of Python using the same installation prefix (`--prefix` argument to the configure script) you must take care that your primary python executable is not overwritten by the installation of a different version. All files and directories installed using `make altinstall` contain the major and minor version and can thus live side-by-side. `make install` also creates `${prefix}/bin/python3` which refers to `${prefix}/bin/python3.X`. If you intend to install multiple versions using the same prefix you must decide which version (if any) is your "primary" version. Install that version using `make install`. Install all other versions using `make altinstall`.

For example, if you want to install Python 2.7, 3.6, and 3.15 with 3.15 being the primary version, you would execute `make install` in your 3.15 build directory and `make altinstall` in the others.
